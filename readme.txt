HOW IT WORKS
Croolle Analytics relies on a third party website (www.croolle.com) where data is submitted and analyzed. 
When a user visits your site, our web servers (using JavaScrit code) automatically register their IP address, Browser type, time spent on page, refferer url, and the current page (the page they are viewing). This information is collected primary for statistical analysis and as described in our terms of service here (https://www.croolle.com/welcome/terms) and privacy policy (https://www.croolle.com/welcome/privacy).

We value your privacy and so only collects this information from your site:
1.	Visitor IP
2.	Browser type
3.	Current page
4.	Time spent on page
5.	Referrer page (page from which the browser came)

Other personal identification like users' names, telephone numbers, addresses and email addresses are technically impossible for the code to collect. To enable Croolle Analytics track what visitors are viewing and when and from which page, we may send a cookie to you visitors' computer. This data is collected primarily to enhance our statistics.
